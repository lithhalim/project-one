## DECMUNTATION

- Create a new repository basic-auth
- Make a POST request to the/signup route with username and password
- Make a POST request to the /signin route
- Keep your authentication related files in a folder called /auth so they are independent of the server itself.
- CRUD Operation: Destroy
- CRETE AUTHINTICATION SECTION BY USE SIGN IN SIGN UP 

#### Implementation Notes
 ###### REMINDER: Your app needs a new dependency today: sequelize
 - npm i sequelize sequelize-cli pg sqlite3
 - Remember to start your Postgres server:
